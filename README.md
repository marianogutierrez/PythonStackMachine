The purpose of this program was to practice tokenization and parsing as done in
program 2. The difference being was to approcah the problem in a pythonic way.

Notes on prog4_1:
    This part of the program made extenisve use of list comprehsnsions and some 
    of pythons helpful syntax not avaliable in other lanauges. For example, list
    comprehensions with the use of "in" were used to greatly simplify checking
    to see if the given tokens were indeed valid. Thus, simplifying the tokenization
    and parsing process. Besides that, the program is of the same functionality and purpose and was the C++
    program in prog2_2. 
    
Notes on prog4_2:
    This program is a behemoth of if-else if. The purpose was to feed the program
    a list of already validated tokens so that it can execute in a stack machine like
    fashion. A stack was used to hold numerical values, and dictionary was used 
    to serve as the computers "memory." By using a dictionary
